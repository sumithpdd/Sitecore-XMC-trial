# 101 Tasks

**Tasks:**

1\.      Navigation: Browse around the pages and see what pretty designs you can build with Sitecore

2\.      Look at how those pages are made up of components

3\.      Working with Pages: Look at how you can just click in and change some text on \<whichever component we think is most easily usable for the author>

4\.      Content Optimization: Maybe you'd like AI to help you rewrite this content while keeping it true to your brand.

5\.      Working with Media Library: Look how you can change the image for it

6\.      Styling Options for Components: Hey, look, you can have a lot of design variations of different components, and you can choose whether you want authors to be able to customize those variants.

7\.      Adding Components: What if you realized you needed another component on this page. Boom, you can drag it right onto the page and put your content in it.

8\.      Personalization: What if you wanted to show different variations of this component to visitors based on where they came from?

9\.      A/B Testing: What if you wanted to test two different versions of the component to see which performs better
